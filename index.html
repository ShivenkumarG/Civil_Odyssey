                <h3>What is PMP:</h3>
                <p>the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration meteorologically possible for a design watershed or a given 
                    storm area at a particular location at a particular time of year, with no allowance made for long-term climatic 
                    trends.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Enveloping Curve:</strong> <br />
                            It's a curve that encompasses all potential peak frequency factors, with the highest achievable frequency 
                            factor closely aligning with the curve's peak, which could also manifest in similar regions or basins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Frequency Factor:</strong> <br />
                            In PMP calculation, the frequency factor indicates the maximum distance from the mean in terms of standard 
                            deviation units.

                <h3>Advantages of Including Climate Change:</h3>
                <p>Overall, incorporating climate change data into calculations of probable maximum precipitation enables 
                    more robust and sustainable infrastructure development, contributing to the long-term well-being and 
                    safety of societies.

                            <strong>Long-term Planning:</strong> <br />
                            By factoring in climate change, planners can develop infrastructure that remains effective and functional 
                            over its intended lifespan, even as environmental conditions evolve.

                <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's crucial to estimate the maximum probable precipitation when designing dams and other infrastructure 
                            because it helps ensure that these structures can withstand the most extreme weather conditions they might 
                            encounter. By accurately predicting the maximum amount of rainfall likely to occur within a certain period, 
                            engineers can design infrastructure with appropriate safety margins to prevent failures or catastrophic 
                            damage during severe storms or flooding events. 
                        </li> 
                        <li> Challenges stemming from climate change demand immediate action, as highlighted in the newspaper articles 
                            and news clippings provided below.
                        
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <figure class="center-image">

                        <br />
                        <li>This careful consideration of precipitation helps enhance the resilience and reliability of critical 
                            infrastructure, safeguarding communities and minimizing the risk of disasters.
