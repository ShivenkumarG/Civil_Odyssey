      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Creation Of A Creature</h1> <br />
      <article>
        <div style="text-align:justify;">
          <h3 style="text-align:center;">Why do i call it “Creation of A Creature”?</h3>
            <p>First and foremost, I enjoy symmetry, and as we can see, Creature and Creation both contain eight alphabet letters and begin with the letter C.
              Second, I was a Hindi medium student until 12th grade, so I was not good at English at the time. Then one day, after the celebration of Independence Day, 
              we were having snacks together with the headmaster and other teachers, and they just tried to check my English and told me to translate a sentence 
              called " मनुष्य एक सामाजिक प्राणी है”, But I couldn't recall the exact English phrase for " प्राणी " so I just translated it as "Human is a Social species." But 
              I wasn't satisfied with the term I stated, so I went to Google and found the word creature, which I couldn't forget.
              <br />
              Moreover, the term "creature" relates directly to humans, as humans are indeed creatures. This connection adds another layer of meaning to "Creation of A 
              Creature." It underscores the idea that humans, as creatures, are a result of creation, emphasizing both the creative process and the inherent nature of 
              humanity. This phrase encapsulates the intricate relationship between creation and the human essence, further highlighting why I find the symmetry and 
              meaning so compelling.

          <p>Humans are an awe-inspiring mix of physical, intellectual, emotional, and social characteristics in this vast universe. Through their desires, 
            accomplishments, and contributions, they continue to influence the world around them, leaving an everlasting imprint on the fabric of life.

        <div style="text-align:justify;">
          <h2 style="text-align:center;">“Let’s begin the family introduction of our character”</h2>
            <p>A Gupta family resides in a house in the hamlet of Hanumangarh, a small village near the 
              city of Sidhi in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
              <br />
              Ram was the oldest son in the family, with two younger brothers and four sisters. When Ram 
              was just 16 years old, his mother died of cancer because she couldn't get medical attention in time due 
              to their difficult family situation. His father owned a small farm of about half an acre, but the income 
              from it wasn't enough to support the family. After completing the tenth grade, Ram left school and started 
              selling items in a small shop made from a metal container. He then built a mud house along the road and 
              opened a small shop there (the house with the farm was approximately half a km within the village's main road). 
              One night, while he was sleeping outside, a cat knocked over a chimney, causing a fire that burned down the entire 
              house and most of its contents. At that time, in 1993, there was no electricity in the village.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, Ram got married and used the dowry money to rebuild his shop. His wife, Rama, brought positive 
              changes to his life. Their first daughter, born in 1996, sadly died within a month due to health complications. The family 
              then welcomed two more daughters. Then,<br /><br /> The family eagerly awaited the arrival of a son. Ram and Rama, a loving family, had long 
              dreamed of having a son in the family, and their anticipation grew with each passing day. The air buzzed with excitement as 
              their loved ones prepared to welcome the joyous occasion. <br /><br />
              Finally, the day arrived when their bundle of joy entered the world, filling the room with cries of new life. It was a magical moment as 
              the tiny baby, with delicate features and tiny fingers, was placed in their arms. Their hearts overflowed with pure happiness 
              and a sense of wonderment at the miracle before them. The date was May 23, 2003, and the sun was at its highest point in the 
              afternoon. The boy was born in his home because the hospital facilities were not available in the village.<br /><br />
              They named him Shiva. As the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the child, named Shiva, became the center of their universe. Their 
              once quiet and peaceful home now resonated with the laughter and gurgles of their little one. With every smile that 
              adorned Shiva's face, their hearts swelled with immeasurable love and pride. <br /><br />
              After a year, the Birth ceremony was celebrated with great enjoyment. Then, the family distribution happened, and a small family of Ram, and 
              Rama with the Son Shiva and two daughters shifted to a home where they had their small shop of Kirana.
