      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Creation Of A Creature</h1> <br />
      <article>
        <div style="text-align:justify;">
          <h3 style="text-align:center;">Why do i call it “Creation of A Creature”?</h3>
            <p>First and foremost, I enjoy symmetry, and as we can see, Creature and Creation both contain eight alphabet letters and begin with the letter C.
              Second, I was a Hindi medium student until 12th grade, so I was not good at English at the time. Then one day, after the celebration of Independence Day, 
              we were having snacks together with the headmaster and other teachers, and they just tried to check my English and told me to translate a sentence 
              called " मनुष्य एक सामाजिक प्राणी है”, But I couldn't recall the exact English phrase for " प्राणी " so I just translated it as "Human is a Social species." But 
              I wasn't satisfied with the term I stated, so I went to Google and found the word creature, which I couldn't forget.
              <br />
              Moreover, the term "creature" relates directly to humans, as humans are indeed creatures. This connection adds another layer of meaning to "Creation of A 
              Creature." It underscores the idea that humans, as creatures, are a result of creation, emphasizing both the creative process and the inherent nature of 
              humanity. This phrase encapsulates the intricate relationship between creation and the human essence, further highlighting why I find the symmetry and 
              meaning so compelling.

        <div style="text-align:justify;">
          <h2 style="text-align:center;">“Let’s begin the family introduction of our character”</h2>
            <p>A Gupta family resides in a house in the hamlet of Hanumangarh, a small village near the 
              city of Sidhi in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
              <br />
              Ram was the oldest son in the family, with two younger brothers and four sisters. When Ram 
              was just 16 years old, his mother died of cancer because she couldn't get medical attention in time due 
              to their difficult family situation. His father owned a small farm of about half an acre, but the income 
              from it wasn't enough to support the family. After completing the tenth grade, Ram left school and started 
              selling items in a small shop made from a metal container. He then built a mud house along the road and 
              opened a small shop there (the house with the farm was approximately half a km within the village's main road). 
              One night, while he was sleeping outside, a cat knocked over a chimney, causing a fire that burned down the entire 
              house and most of its contents. At that time, in 1993, there was no electricity in the village.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, Ram got married and used the dowry money to rebuild his shop. His wife, Rama, brought positive 
              changes to his life. Their first daughter, born in 1996, sadly died within a month due to health complications. The family 
              then welcomed two more daughters. Then,<br /><br /> The family eagerly awaited the arrival of a son. Ram and Rama, a loving family, had long 
              dreamed of having a son in the family, and their anticipation grew with each passing day. The air buzzed with excitement as 
              their loved ones prepared to welcome the joyous occasion. <br /><br />
              Finally, the day arrived when their bundle of joy entered the world, filling the room with cries of new life. It was a magical moment as 
              the tiny baby, with delicate features and tiny fingers, was placed in their arms. Their hearts overflowed with pure happiness 
              and a sense of wonderment at the miracle before them. The date was May 23, 2003, and the sun was at its highest point in the 
              afternoon. The boy was born in his home because the hospital facilities were not available in the village.<br /><br />
              They named him Shiva. As the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the child, named Shiva, became the center of their universe. Their 
              once quiet and peaceful home now resonated with the laughter and gurgles of their little one. With every smile that 
              adorned Shiva's face, their hearts swelled with immeasurable love and pride. <br /><br />
              After a year, the Birth ceremony was celebrated with great enjoyment. Then, the family distribution happened, and a small family of Ram, and 
              Rama with the Son Shiva and two daughters shifted to a home where they had their small shop of Kirana.

          <p>Shiva started going to school with his sisters. Despite his reluctance, he had to go because his sister had said she 
            wouldn't attend if he didn't. Rama would drop him off at school, but as a child, he wanted to come back home with his 
            mother. His mother would threaten, "If you don't go to school, the barber uncle will cut your ear," (the barber's shop 
            was right in front of the school) which kept Shiva at school.

          <p>Shiva was formally enrolled in school. The school had a policy where if three children from the same family were enrolled,
             the youngest child’s fees would be waived. Due to his basic understanding, Shiva was admitted directly into 1st grade 
             instead of nursery. Ram chose to enroll him in a private school called Saraswati Shishu Mandir because the village's 
             government school had poor teaching conditions. Additionally, Shiva and his sisters received home instruction from a 
             tutor. Shiva excelled and passed the 1st grade exams with the highest rank in his school.

          <p>When Shiva was in second grade, he memorized multiplication tables from 2 to 30, a feat even 8th graders struggled with. 
            This became a notable memory at his school. One day, he was called to the classroom of the 7th and 8th graders (due to 
            limited student numbers, rooms, and teachers, students from classes 1st and 2nd sat together, as did students from 3rd and 
            4th, and so on until the 8th grade) to check their classwork, where they had to write tables from 21 to 30. The teacher 
            handed Shiva a small stick, telling him to use it if anyone made mistakes. Shiva examined their work and found errors in 
            each one but refused to use the stick, despite the older students agreeing to be corrected by the younger boy and 
            playfully wanting to be disciplined by him.

            chunmun, go to the shop to buy a whole bundle, and then distribute it to everyone.

          <p>Shiva was in the third grade. On the 13th of December 2010, Shiva had his first half-yearly test. He received the exam 
            paper and notebook and began writing when suddenly a man riding a bicycle from Shiva's home side informed Shiva's 
            instructor that his Grandfather had died. Shiva's grandfather Shambhu had passed away peacefully in his sleep. 
            Shiva's heart sank, and a wave of sadness washed over him. It was as if a part of him had been torn 
            away, leaving behind a void that seemed impossible to fill. Shiva and his sisters were allowed to leave 
            and return home. Shiva was taken aback when he saw a dead body in front of him for the first time.
            Shiva's grandfather died due to a protracted infection in his legs that was not thoroughly operated on and did not 
            receive better treatment from a large hospital, and the hospital situation in the hamlet is as if there were no physicians 
            at all.
